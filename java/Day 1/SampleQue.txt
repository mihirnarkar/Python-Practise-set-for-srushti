               ****************** House Price Checker ***********************

Create a Java program that allows a user to check the price of a house by entering its name. You'll define a few houses with their names and prices in the program.


Here are the requirements for the program:

Create a class called House with the following attributes:

1) String name (Name of the house)
2) int price (Price of the house)
3) Define three House objects with different names and prices in your main program.


Implement a console-based menu with the following options:

Check house price by name.
Exit the program.
When the user selects "Check house price by name," they should be prompted to enter the name of a house, and the program should display the price of that house. If the entered name does not match any of the predefined houses, display an error message.

Keep running the program until the user chooses to exit.


****************** Your output must match like these **********************
