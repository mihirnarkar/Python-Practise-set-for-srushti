***************  Basic Calculator *****************

Create a Java program that acts as a basic calculator. The program should allow the user to perform simple arithmetic operations on two numbers.

Here are the requirements for the program:

Implement a console-based menu with the following options:

Add two numbers.
Subtract two numbers.
Multiply two numbers.
Divide two numbers.
Exit the program.
When the user selects any of the arithmetic operations, they should be prompted to enter two numbers.

Perform the selected operation on the two numbers and display the result.

Handle division by zero by displaying an error message.

Keep running the program until the user chooses to exit.
